#  Superstore Sales Performance Analysis
Welcome to the **Superstore Sales Analysis** project! This repository presents an end-to-end data analysis pipeline using Python and Power BI to extract actionable insights from a retail sales dataset.

# Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data from a fictional superstore to uncover trends, evaluate category-wise performance, and understand regional profitability. It supports strategic business decisions through data cleaning, SQL-style queries, visualization, and business recommendations.

# Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python** – Data wrangling and analysis
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **pandasql** – SQL-style queries using SQLite
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive data exploration
- **Power BI** – Dashboard reporting (guide included)

#  Dataset Description
The dataset simulates customer orders from a superstore, including product details, customer info, dates, sales, discounts, profit, and regional data.

# Key Columns:
- `Order Date`, `Ship Date`
- `Customer ID`, `Segment`, `Region`
- `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Sales`, `Profit`, `Discount`, `Quantity`
- 
#  Key Analysis Performed
-  Data cleaning and preprocessing
-  Trend analysis (monthly and category-wise)
-  Sub-category profit evaluation
-  Region/state performance breakdown
-  SQL-style queries with `pandasql`
-  Statistical summaries
-  Business recommendations
  
# Visualizations
 Found in Jupyter Notebook and Power BI Guide
- Bar plots: Category/Sub-category sales
- Line charts: Monthly sales trend
- Pie charts: Profit by region
- SQL tables: Top 5 products by revenue
- Heatmaps, scatter plots, and more

# Business Insights
-  Highest sales occur during Nov–Dec
-  Technology drives revenue but has variable profit margins
-  High discounts reduce profit significantly
-  Eastern and Western regions show consistent growth
